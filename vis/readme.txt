simulate_progress_model.R
------------------------- 
Defines some simulated data to drive the visualisation functions; this data is somewhat arbitrary and not intended to be a robust probabilistic model of *actual* rater behaviours, rather to generate data that is plausible based
on sum of binomials/bernoullis.


vis_functions.R
---------------

Number of functions to visualise the rating data for a single symptom as a kind of "voting" system,
and as vectors representing agreement between raters, plus some ways of showing cumulative change over time.


demo_vis.R
----------
Script (with documentation) on how to visualise the data generated by simulated raters (simulate_progress_model.R)
It demonstrates how to generate the aggregated data from raw data (assumed to have been pulled from a database) and then plot a variety of representations
